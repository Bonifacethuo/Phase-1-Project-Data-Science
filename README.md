# Phase-1-Project-Data-Science
**##Aviation Accident Analysis**
**#Overview**  This project analyzes aviation accident data to recommend the best aircraft for your company to invest in. The analysis focuses on identifying low-risk aircraft to guide strategic business decisions in aviation.
**##Business Problem**
The company plans to diversify into aviation but lacks knowledge about aircraft risks. The objective is to determine potential risks associated with different aircraft makes and provide three actionable investment recommendations to the head of the Aviation division.
**#Data Understanding**
Source: National Transportation Safety Board (1962-2023)
Scope: Civil aviation accidents in the U.S. and international waters
Dataset: 18 columns, around 9600 entries
Categories: Investigation type, aircraft make/model, location, passenger injuries, aircraft damage, etc.
**#Data Analysis Methods**
Descriptive Analysis: Explores accident frequency by aircraft make and severity.
Comparative Analysis: Compares accident ratios and injury counts across different makes.
Visualization: Creates charts for clearer risk comparison.
The goal is to determine which aircraft models offer the least potential risk for investment.
**#Results Summary**
Top Risk Aircraft Makes: Cessna, Piper, Beech (high accident counts and injury rates)
Low-Risk Aircraft Make: Boeing (lower accident-to-event ratio)
Private vs. Commercial: Higher accident rates for small private aircraft (Cessna) due to human errors and lack of safety measures.
**#Key Recommendations**
Focus on Low-Risk Makes: Prioritize makes with fewer accidents and affected passengers. 
Monitor Weather Impact: Consider weather-related risks when assessing aircraft. 
Boeing is recommended, but invest in a high-quality maintenance team
Prioritize Commercial Aircraft:
Smaller private aircraft are riskier than larger commercial options.
